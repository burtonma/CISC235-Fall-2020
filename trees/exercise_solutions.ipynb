    "  **Proof** (by contradiction) Assume that the maximum value is not stored in the rightmost node of the tree. Then the maximum   value must be in a left subtree of some node $m$. This is a contradiction because every value in the left subtree is less than or equal to the value in node $m$ by the binary search tree property. If the value is less than the value in node $m$ then it is not the maximum value in the tree and the assumption is false. If the value is equal to the value in node $m$ then $m$ is the rightmost node of the tree and the assumption is false.\n",
