If $n$ is a 3-node, then all elements whose value is between the two elements in $n$ can be found by folling the middle child link.\n",
    "\n",
    "Insertion works by adding an element to a 2-node or 3-node at the bottom level of the tree. For example, adding the element 12 in the tree above would cause the 2-node containing the 10 to become a 3-node containing 10 and 12.\n",
