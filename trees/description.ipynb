    "# Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "A (rooted) tree is an abstract data type that can be defined as a collection of nodes where each node has a data value and a list of references to other nodes called *child* nodes or children. The structure of a tree is defined recursively as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a tree has a single *root* node that is the parent node of zero or more child nodes\n",
    "* each child of the root node is itself a root node for another distinct subtree (i.e., there are no duplicated child nodes) where each subtree is disjoint from all other subtrees (disjoint means that the trees have no nodes in common)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following figure shows an example of a tree of integer values. The root node is the top-most node having a data value of 50. The children of the root node (the nodes with values 34, 11, and 6) are themselves the root nodes of three disjoint trees. Notice that every child node has exactly one parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "![A tree](../resources/images/bst-1/Slide4.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe that a tree has a hierarchical branching structure that resembles a physical tree drawn upside down. Flipping the tree produces a visualization that more closely resembles an actual tree, but trees are usually drawn in the upside down style.\n",
    "\n",
    "![An upside down tree](../resources/images/bst-1/Slide5.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "The line ending in an arrow that connect a parent node to a child node is called an *edge*. An edge in a tree is the visual representation of a reference to a child node belonging to a parent node. A tree implementation may also have an edge from the child node to the parent node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trees are widely used in data structures ([see this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures#Trees)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Root node\n",
    "\n",
    "The root node of a tree is the node having no parent. Many tree algorithms start at the root node.\n",
    "\n",
    "![The root node of a tree](../resources/images/bst-1/Slide7.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Leaf nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "A node having no children is called a *leaf* node. In the following figure the leaf nodes are shown in green.\n",
    "\n",
    "![The leaf nodes of a tree](../resources/images/bst-1/Slide9.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Internal nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "A node that has children is called an *internal* node. The root node is an internal node unless it is the only node in the tree, in which case it is a leaf. In the previous figure, all nodes not coloured green are internal nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subtrees\n",
    "\n",
    "The recursive structure of a tree means that every node of the tree is the root of a subtree. The following three figures show the root nodes of three subtrees:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Subtree 1](../resources/images/bst-1/Slide11.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Subtree 1](../resources/images/bst-1/Slide14.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Subtree 1](../resources/images/bst-1/Slide15.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 1** Is a leaf node the root of a subtree? If so, how many elements are in such a tree?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "If $n_1, n_2, ..., n_k$ is a sequence of nodes where $n_i$ is the parent of $n_{i+1}$ then the sequence is called a *simple downward path* from $n_1$ to $n_k$. The length of such a path is $k - 1$ which is equal to the number of edges connecting the two nodes. If there is a path from node $m$ to $n$ then $m$ is called an *ancestor* of $n$ and $n$ is called a *descendent* of $m$. The following two figures illustrate paths of lengths 2 and 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Path of length 2](../resources/images/bst-1/Slide17.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Path of length 3](../resources/images/bst-1/Slide18.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple path is a path that contains no repeated nodes. In trees that contains links from child nodes to parent nodes simple paths are not always directed downwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 2** What is the length of the simple downward path between the nodes containing the elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - 50 and 11?\n",
    "    - 6 and 1?\n",
    "    - 88 and 99?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Level or depth\n",
    "\n",
    "The *level* or *depth* of a node $n$ is the length of the downward simple path from the root node to $n$. The root node has a level or depth of 0. The following figure illustrates the depth of several nodes in a tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Levels or depths](../resources/images/bst-1/Slide20.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 3** Consider a tree having $k$ nodes. What is the maximum node depth in such a tree? Draw an example of a tree having your maximum node depth?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 4** Consider a tree having $k$ nodes and consider the node with the maximum depth. What is the smallest maximum node depth in such a tree? Draw an example of a tree having your minimum node depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Height\n",
    "\n",
    "The *height* of a node $n$ is the number of edges on the longest downward simple path from $n$ to a leaf. The height of a tree is equal to the height of its root node. The height of the tree in the previous figure is 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 5** What is the height of a leaf node?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 6** What is the height of a tree having only one element?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 7** Consider a tree having $k$ nodes. What is the maximum height of such a tree?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 8** Consider a tree having $k$ nodes. What is the minimum height of such a tree?"
