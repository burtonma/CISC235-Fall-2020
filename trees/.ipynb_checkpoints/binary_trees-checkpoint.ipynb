    "# Binary trees\n",
    "\n",
    "A binary tree is a tree where each node has at most two children. Traditionally, the child nodes are the called the *left* and *right* nodes. For example, the following figure illustrates the left and right nodes of the root node of a binary tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Left and right nodes](../resources/images/bst-1/Slide23.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "A non-leaf node may have only one child; for example, the following figure illustrates a node having only a right child:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Only right node](../resources/images/bst-1/Slide25.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Full binary tree\n",
    "\n",
    "Every node in a full binary tree is either a leaf node or is an internal node with two child nodes. The following figure illustrates a full binary tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Full binary tree](../resources/images/bst-1/Slide28.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 1** What is the minimum number of elements in a full binary tree of height 3?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complete binary tree\n",
    "\n",
    "In a complete binary tree of height $h$ all levels except possibly level $h - 1$ are completely full. If the bottom-most level $h - 1$ is not full then the nodes are filled in from left to right. The following figure illustrates a complete binary tree:\n",

    "![Complete binary tree](../resources/images/bst-1/Slide30.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the figure above, the nodes with values 7 and 19 can be switched but they must be children of the node with value 8 if the tree is to be considered a complete binary tree.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Perfect binary tree\n",
    "\n",
    "A perfect binary tree is a complete binary tree where the last level of the tree is full. An equivalent definition is that a perfect binary is a complete binary tree where all of the leaves are on the same level. The following figure illustrates a perfect binary tree:\n",

    "# A partial implementation of a binary tree\n",
    "\n",
    "As we will see in later notebooks, there are many different types of binary trees. Every binary tree implemented using nodes has a root node and a size. We can place the features that are common to all node-based binary trees into an abstract base class called `BinaryTree` that implements the `Tree` interface. Concrete implementations of binary trees, such as binary search trees and red-black trees, will extend the abstract `BinaryTree` base class. Because the root node of a binary tree is the starting point to many tree algorithms, child classes of `BinaryTree` are given direct access to the root node (by giving the field `root` protected access) and via the protected methods `getRoot()` and `setRoot(BinaryNode)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the class does not give public access to the root node of a tree. If a user were to gain access to any node of a tree then the user could modify the elements stored in the tree and change the structure of the tree. This would make it impossible for the different type of tree classes to preserve their class invariants. For example, a binary search tree imposes rules regarding the relative placement of elements in the tree; if a user modified the elements of the tree directly then the binary search tree would not be able to satisfy its methods contracts."
