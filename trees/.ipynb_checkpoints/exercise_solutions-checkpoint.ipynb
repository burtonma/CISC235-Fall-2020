    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Yes a leaf node is the root of a subtree having 1 element.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. 1, 2, and no downward path exists between 88 and 99\n",
    "\n",
    "3. $k - 1$. The tree looks like a linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. $1$. The tree has a root and $k - 1$ nodes in level 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The height of a leaf node is $0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The root is a leaf node if there is only one element in the tree; therefore, the height of such a tree is $0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. $k - 1$. See Exercise 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. $1$. See Exercise 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Binary trees\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 7. The root must have two child nodes. In level 1, one node is a leaf node and the other node has two children. In level 2, one node is a leaf node and the other node has two children.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - 1\n",
    "    - 2 to 3\n",
    "    - 4 to 7\n",
    "    - 8 to 15\n",
    "    - $2^k$ to $2^{k+1} - 1$\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. $2^{k+1} - 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. $2^k$\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The nodes with elements 44, 65, and 83 can have a leaf node attached to them so that the tree remains a height-balanced tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## A class for binary tree nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\n",
    "    1. Removes the left subtree of $n$.\n",
    "    2. Removes the right subtree of $n$.\n",
    "    3. `return !this.hasLeft() && !this.hasRight();`\n",
    "    4. `return this.hasLeft() != this.hasRight();`\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Random binary tree\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $O(n)$ because a random binary tree has a maximum height of $n-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. $O(n)$ because `contains` must examine every element in the worst case.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Traversals\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - breadth-first: A, G, S, X, B, Y, N\n",
    "    - pre-order: A, G, X, B, N, S, Y\n",
    "    - in-order: X, G, N, B, A, S, Y\n",
    "    - post-order: X, N, B, G, Y, S, A\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. No solution provided; the implementations are line by line translations of the pseudocode algorithms into Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. No solution provided. The height of a non-empty tree $t$ is defined recursively as $1 + \\text{max}(\\text{height}(t.root.left), \\text{height}(t.root.right))$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. See the `BinaryNode.java` class [here](../resources/src/ca/queensu/cs/cisc235/tree/BinaryNode.java).\n",
