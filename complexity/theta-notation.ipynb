However, we need to keep in mind that the complexity results hold only in the limit of large $n$. Often choosing an algorithm with a worse big-$O$ complexity is preferred for smaller problem sizes. For example, most library implementations of sorting algorithms having worse-case complexity $O(n \\log n)$ internally use insertion sort for small input sizes even though insertion sort is in $O(n^2)$ (for example, see Python's standard sorting algorithm [Timsort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort))."

    "\n",
    "> There are two general-purpose List implementations â€” ArrayList and LinkedList. Most of the time, you'll probably use ArrayList, which offers constant-time positional access and is just plain fast. It does not have to allocate a node object for each element in the List, and it can take advantage of System.arraycopy when it has to move multiple elements at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "> If you frequently add elements to the beginning of the List or iterate over the List to delete elements from its interior, you should consider using LinkedList. These operations require constant-time in a LinkedList and linear-time in an ArrayList. But you pay a big price in performance. Positional access requires linear-time in a LinkedList and constant-time in an ArrayList. Furthermore, the constant factor for LinkedList is much worse. If you think you want to use a LinkedList, measure the performance of your application with both LinkedList and ArrayList before making your choice; ArrayList is usually faster."
