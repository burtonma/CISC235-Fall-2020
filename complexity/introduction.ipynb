    "# Computational complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational complexity is often the criterion used to select a particular data structure over another data structure. A commmon example of using computational complexity to choose between different implementations of a data structure is choosing between an array-based list or a linked list implementation. Quoting from [the official Java tutorials](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/implementations/list.html):\n",
    "\n",
    "> There are two general-purpose List implementations â€” ArrayList and LinkedList. Most of the time, you'll probably use ArrayList, which offers constant-time positional access and is just plain fast. It does not have to allocate a node object for each element in the List, and it can take advantage of System.arraycopy when it has to move multiple elements at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "> If you frequently add elements to the beginning of the List or iterate over the List to delete elements from its interior, you should consider using LinkedList. These operations require constant-time in a LinkedList and linear-time in an ArrayList. But you pay a big price in performance. Positional access requires linear-time in a LinkedList and constant-time in an ArrayList. Furthermore, the constant factor for LinkedList is much worse. If you think you want to use a LinkedList, measure the performance of your application with both LinkedList and ArrayList before making your choice; ArrayList is usually faster.\n",
