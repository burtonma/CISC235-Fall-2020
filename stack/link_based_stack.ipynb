Pushing an element on to the stack is equivalent to adding a node to the front of the list. Popping an element from the stack is equivalent to removing the node from the front of the linked list.\n",

In an empty stack, `this.top` is equal to `null` indicating that there is no element at the top of the stack."

    "## What is a static member class in Java\n",
    "\n",
    "In Java a *nested class* is a class defined inside of another class. A nested class should exist only to serve its enclosing class; if a nested class would be useful on its own then it should be top-level class.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *static member class* is the simplest kind of nested class in Java. It is essentially an ordinary class that happens to be declared inside of another class. An instance of a static member class can exist in isolation from an instance of the enclosing class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other kinds of nested classes in Java require instances of such classes to always have an associated instance of the enclosing class; the compiler adds a hidden reference to the enclosing class to every instance of a non-static nested class. This hidden reference costs memory to store the reference which is why a nested class should be declared static if possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the stack example, a `Node` object never needs access to a `LinkedStack` object so it can be implemented as a static member class."
