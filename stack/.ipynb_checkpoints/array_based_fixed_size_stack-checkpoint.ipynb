    "\n",

    "\n",
    "An empty stack is represented by an array where all of the elements are equal to `null` and the field `this.top` is equal to `-1`. Remember that `this.top` is the index of the top element of the stack and there are no elements in an empty stack:\n",

    "In the `pop` method the statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "        // null out the value stored in the array\n",
    "        this.arr[this.top] = null;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "is important from a performance perspective. If we omit the statement from the method the method will still work and would likely pass unit test suites written by many programmers. The problem with omitting the statement is that it is possible in a running program that the array value at `this.arr[this.top]` is never overwritten in which case the array will contain a reference to an element that is no longer in the stack. The Java garbage collector will be unable to free the memory associated with the (potentially unused) element. For a single element this is not a great concern but imagine the situation where a user pushes millions of elements on to a stack and then pops all of the elements from the stack; furthermore, imagine that the user's program eventually releases all of the element references. The millions of objects that are no longer required by the program cannot be garbage collected from memory if the stack array is still storing references to the elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because the stack array remains in memory as long as the stack object does it is important that we manage what is stored in the array which means that we must `null` out unused references in the array whenever we pop elements from the stack."
