A hash value for the 64-bit primitive types `double` and `long` can be obtained by splitting their 64-bit representation into two 32-bit values and then combining the two values in some bitwise fashion; details can be found by reading the documentation for [Double.hashCode](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Double.html#hashCode--) and [Long.hashCode](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Long.html#hashCode--).\n",
