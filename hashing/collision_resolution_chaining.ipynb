An obvious alternative strategy is to overwrite the existing key-value pair. Both strategies result in adding a key-value pair in $O(1)$ time but they have obvious significant drawbacks."

    "In *chaining* or *separate chaining* each bucket holds a reference to some kind of container.

    "\n",
    "In a hash table that uses chaining with linked lists each bucket contains a reference to a linked list; in other words, the array $t$ becomes an array of linked lists. Instead of using a full featured linked list, we can use a linked-node structure identical to the one that we used when implementing linked stacks. The Java standard library class `java.util.Hashtable` is an example of an implementation that uses chaining with a linked-node structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `contains`, `get`, `put` and `remove` operations all involve searching a linked list for a key when a collision occurs. In the worst-case, all $n$ key-value pairs in the hash table can be located in a single linked list; therefore, the worst-case complexity of these operations is in $O(n)$.\n",
    "\n",

If a key-value pair is not in the hash table then we need to examine every element of a linked list testing the key of each element for equality to $k$ (each equality test can be done in constant time) and there are on average $\\Theta(\\alpha)$ key-value pairs in the list. Therefore, the total amount of time to compute the hash function and search a linked list at a bucket is $\\Theta(1 + \\alpha)$.\n",

    "\n",
