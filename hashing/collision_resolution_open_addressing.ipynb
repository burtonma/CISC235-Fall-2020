    "# Collision resolution: Open addressing\n",
    "\n",
    "In chaining, key-value pairs are stored in data structures external to the hash table array. Open addressing is the name for techniques that resolve collisions by searching for empty locations in the hash table array. When adding a key-value pair the basic idea is to start at the bucket that the key hashes to and then proceed to additional buckets in a *probe sequence* until an empty bucket is found. When searching for a key, the buckets are probed in the same sequence until the key is found or an empty bucket is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "A drawback of open addressing is that the number of key-value pairs $n$ cannot exceed the hash table size $m$ and performance degrades severely as the hash table becomes almost full. Open addressing also places more requirements on the hash function as we shall see.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 1** What is the maximum load factor when using open addressing?\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequence of array locations probed depends on the key that is being used to access the hash table. The hash function is extended to have the form $h(k, i)$ where the second integer parameter $i$ takes on the values $0, 1, 2, ..., m-1$. The parameter $i$ is called the *probe number*. When we search for a key $k$ we start by calling the hash function with $i = 0$. If the bucket $h(k, 0)$ is occupied, then we increment $i$ so that $i=1$ and try again. If the bucket $h(k, 1)$ is occupied, then we increment $i$ so that $i=2$ and try again. We repeat the process of incrementing $i$ until we find an open bucket or until $i = m$. If $i = m$ then we have probed every location in the hash table without finding an open bucket and we conclude that the hash table array is full.\n",
    "\n",
    "For open addressing to work correctly we need to ensure that the probe sequence\n",
