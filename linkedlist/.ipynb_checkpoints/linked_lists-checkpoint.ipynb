    "Our linked list implementation uses the same `Node` class as we used when implementing a node-based stack. We make some intentional choices to break information hiding by having the static member class `Node` be package private, and by providing package private methods `head()` and `tail()` that return references to the head and tail nodes, respectively. The reason for doing this is that many linked list algorithms require access to the nodes of the list and we cannot implement every conceivable list algorithm in the `LinkedList` class directly.\n",
